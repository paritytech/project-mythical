# ðŸ§Ÿ Zombienet Setup Guide

You can find linux and macOS executables of the Zombienet CLI here:

https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases
Download the Zombienet CLI according to your operating system.

Include the binary on the bin folder and allow it to be executed:

```sh
# On Linux
chmod +x bin/zombienet-linux-x64
# Or on Mac
chmod +x bin/zombienet-macos
```

Tip: If you want the executable to be available system-wide then you can follow these steps (otherwise just download the executable to your working directory):

```sh
wget https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases/download/v1.3.91/zombienet-macos
chmod +x zombienet-macos
cp zombienet-macos /usr/local/bin
```

Make sure Zombienet CLI is installed correctly:

```sh
./zombienet-macos --help
```

You should see some similar output:
